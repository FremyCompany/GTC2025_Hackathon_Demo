Hey! Could you provide some tips for the caregiver of the following patient, who is a relative? Start by summarizing what happened and the current state of the patient, then suggest new symptoms to look for, tips, reminders, or phone apps that could help care fo this patient in the future. Be extremely empathetic with your approach, as the patient is a relative of the caregiver. Make sure not to use too much medical jargon, the caregiver is not a trained medical professional, just a relative.

Here is the patient record:
