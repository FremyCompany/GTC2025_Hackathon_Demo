	"HOSPITAL COURSE AND DISCHARGE SUMMARY:\n\nPatient C, a 39-year-old female with Class IV obesity and vitamin B12 deficiency, was admitted to the medical weight management program. The patient experienced weight gain during the bariatric surgical workup, being unable to adhere to the bariatric nutrition plan and physical activity plan prescribed by the surgical team. As a result, she was started on topiramate 25 mg to reduce overall hunger drive. The medication was adjusted to 50 mg after five months to combat an increase in hunger drive and was further increased to 75 mg after 15 months due to a similar reason.\n\nPatient C lost a total of 56.70 kg (36% TBWL) after taking topiramate for 22 months, resulting in a BMI of 35.4 kg/m\u00b2. The weight loss with topiramate was similar to the projected weight loss of RYGB as predicted by the MBSAQIP risk calculator. The patient denied any side effects of cognitive dullness, paresthesia, or dysgeusia during the treatment.\n\nThe patient's medical challenges included increased appetite, carbohydrate cravings, and depressive symptoms related to her weight. Her blood chemistry review at the time of initial bariatric consult showed high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels that improved during the treatment period. She was unable to follow the physical activity plan due to time restrictions. Review of the patient's medication list showed no obesogenic medications contributing to weight gain. She was weight loss medication-na\u00efve before starting the treatment.\n\nAs a result of the robust weight loss, her surgical workup was put on hold. The patient was educated on the importance of a healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity to maintain her weight loss progress achieved by the medication. The patient was also advised to continue her follow-ups with the medical weight management program.\n\nIn summary, Patient C's medical challenges related to her weight were successfully managed with topiramate. The patient achieved significant weight loss, leading to BMI reduction and improvement in blood chemistry levels. The medication was tolerated well, and the patient did not experience any side effects. The patient was discharged with appropriate counseling and follow-up plans.",

	"Hospital Course:\nPatient 3 is a 35-year-old male who was admitted for further evaluation of a genetic skin condition. The patient was born as a collodion baby and presented with fine white scaling and mild erythema throughout his entire body in infancy. As an adult, the patient only had mild erythema on his face and palmar hyperlinearity. Daily use of topical emollients and moisturizing gels was the only treatment he received.\n\nDiagnostic Assessment:\nNext-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of 13 ARCI genes captured in the panel did not reveal any disease-relevant SNV in patient 3. Visual evaluation of read depth and coverage of all the ARCI gene-related exons revealed that exons from 3 to 15 of ALOX12B had no reads in patient 3, whereas they had an average read depth of about 70X in other patients analyzed in the same analytic session. This finding indicated that patient 3 was homozygous for a large deletion removing genomic sequences, including exon 3 to 15 of ALOX12B. This deletion was confirmed by duplex PCR analysis. His consanguineous parents were heterozygous carriers of the deletion, as demonstrated by qPCR.\n\nTreatment:\nThe patient did not receive any specific treatment during his hospital stay and was only advised to continue using topical emollients and moisturizing gels to manage his mild symptoms.\n\nFollow-Up Care:\nThe patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with his healthcare provider regularly. He was advised to seek genetic counseling and undergo genetic testing to assess the risk of passing on the deletion to his offspring.\n\nSummary:\nPatient 3 is a 35-year-old male with a genetic skin condition characterized by fine white scaling and mild erythema. NGS analysis showed no disease-relevant SNV, and visual analysis revealed a homozygous deletion removing genomic sequences including exon 3 to 15 of ALOX12B. The patient was discharged with advice to continue using topical emollients and moisturizing gels and to seek genetic counseling.",

The patient's ocular history prior to being seen by our retina service revealed bilateral pseudophakia followed by subsequent laser capsulotomies for bilateral posterior capsular opacification. He received a total of eighteen injections of ranibizumab and three injections of bevacizumab for the treatment of his eye conditions. \n\nPrevious IOP levels in both eyes were stable until the patient started receiving intravitreal injections, after which he had occasional elevations in IOP up to 20-21 mm Hg in his right eye over the first three years of treatment. After receiving twelve intravitreal injections, the patient began to have fluctuations in right eye IOP ranging from 22-26 mm Hg. Upon examination twelve weeks after the eighteenth injection of ranibizumab, the patient was found to have an IOP of 32 mm Hg on the right side. \n\nThe patient was started on brimonidine three times a day, and upon follow-up examination, his IOP was found to have decreased to 22 mm Hg. The patient was referred to the glaucoma service, and gonioscopic examination demonstrated what appeared to be kerato-precipitates on the trabecular meshwork. Brimonidine was stopped, and the patient was started on prednisolone acetate 1% four times a day. The IOP decreased to 18 mm Hg three days later.\n\nWhile the anterior chamber was initially devoid of any inflammatory cells, slight cell and flare appeared on subsequent follow-up examinations and then faded with the continued topical steroid therapy. Subsequent workup for uveitis was negative. The IOP remained low over subsequent visits without the use of topical pressure lowering drops, and the kerato-precipitates resolved. The patient has been weaned off of the steroid drops without recurrence of inflammation or IOP spikes, and further use of anti-VEGF agents has been avoided.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis: Exudative and Non-exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) with Secondary Ocular Hypertension\n\nSummary:\n\nThe patient was admitted for treatment of exudative and non-exudative AMD.

The patient had a preoperative diagnosis of a large subpulmonic VSD, small ostium secundum ASD, large PDA with left to right shunt, mild coarctation of aorta, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, with L-posed great arteries, and normal biventricular function.\n\nFollowing induction, right radial artery and right internal jugular vein were cannulated. Intraoperatively, it was discovered that the patient had a rare complex cardiac lesion known as anatomically corrected malposition of great arteries with a large subpulmonic VSD, isthmic narrowing, and a large PDA. The VSD closure was performed with a Dacron patch, and the ASD was closed by direct closure. PDA ligation was done, which also addressed the isthmic narrowing. \n\nPostoperatively, the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, and a postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram showed good biventricular function, with no turbulence, no gradient, and good pulsatile flow in the descending aorta, indicating no coarctation of aorta. However, there was acidosis on blood gas analysis, and the femoral pulses were feeble as compared to radial. \n\nThe patient was immediately taken to the operation theatre with suspicion of iatrogenic COA. Due to abnormal positioning of great vessels, the large PDA appeared to be left pulmonary artery and isthmus as PDA, which was ligated. Repair of the isthmic narrowing was done by resection and end-to-end anastomosis by thoracotomy.\n\nFollowing the procedure, the patient was closely monitored in the postoperative intensive care unit. The femoral arterial line was placed, which showed good pulsatile trace but the pressures were 40/16 mmHg, and the radial pressures were 70/36 mmHg.\n\nThe patient's condition improved, and the femoral arterial line was removed.

	"Discharge Summary:\n\nPatient Information:\nName:-\nAge: 68\nGender: Male\n\nMedical History:\nThe patient had a Grade I subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH) in 2004 due to a ruptured anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysm. He underwent an initial endovascular coiling followed by a repeated coil embolization in 2008. In 2010, the patient presented with recanalization of the previously treated ACOM aneurysm.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient presented with a recurrent ACOM aneurysm, which was treated with further coiling. During the procedure, the coil herniated in the parent vessel. A subsequent injection demonstrated the thrombosis of the left A2 in the anterior cerebral artery without flow distal to the migrated coil.\n\nThe SSEP signals were lost from the right leg, and the patient underwent a Merci retriever procedure to retrieve the migrated coil. An exchange maneuver was performed to replace the femoral access with an 8F sheath. An 8F Merci balloon guide catheter was also exchanged to replace the 6 F Envoy catheter and placed in the right ICA with the aim to diminish flow by inflating the balloon at the tip of the Merci guide while retrieving the coil. Tissue plasminogen activator was infused, and an 18 L Merci microcatheter was then advanced proximal to the migrated coil before deploying a V2.0 soft Merci retriever that successfully ensnared the migrated coil. The coil was then brought down to the tip of the guide catheter. At this point, an Alligator 2 mm Retrieval Device was utilized to grab the coil and bring it inside the guide catheter.\n\nOutcome:\nPostprocedure angiography demonstrated patency of the left A2. The SSEP signals returned to normal. Postoperatively, the patient remained neurologically intact and was scheduled for a repeated coiling in the future.\n\nFollow-up:\nFollow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and plan the future course of treatment for the recurrent ACOM aneurysm.",

Upon presentation, the patient was in asystolic cardiac arrest, however, cardiocerebral revascularization was established after an extended resuscitation process. Subsequent history revealed that the patient had experienced a similar syncopal attack a year prior. Initial diagnostic brain imaging indicated a diffuse, superficial subarachnoid hemorrhage with cerebral edema, which precluded neurosurgical intervention. The patient was managed conservatively with neuroprotective measures.\n\nHospital Course:\nIn the following days, the patient's respiratory function began to deteriorate, leading to an acute respiratory infection in the context of presumed sepsis with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, cerebral diabetes insipidus was diagnosed due to electrolyte imbalances. Despite escalating treatment with cultures and antibiotic administration, the patient continued to worsen, subsequently developing multiorgan dysfunction, acute renal failure, liver failure, and metabolic acidosis.\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nThe patient ultimately passed away due to cardiac arrest while on ventilator care, the result of extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Pathological examination revealed multiple tufts of irregular, dilated vessels in the basilar and interpeduncular cistern area, leading to cerebral edema and brain parenchymal liquefaction. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of cavernous vascular malformations, suspicious for cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM).\n\nDischarge Plan:\nThe patient was discharged to the care of a funeral home for ultimate disposition. Family members were notified of the patient's passing, and condolences were offered.",

The demarcation line between the enamel and the dentin of the affected teeth was not clear, and the enamel was hypoplastic. All the involved teeth had enlarged pulp chambers and short-slender roots. A periapical radiolucent lesion was detected in the maxillary left primary molar region, which was related to the gingival abscess. The maxillary left first permanent molar appeared to suffer from the same anomaly.\n\nBased on the clinical and radiological findings, a diagnosis of Regional Odontodysplasia was proposed. The patient underwent extraction of the left maxillary primary molar, restoration of the maxillary second molar with stainless steel crown (SS-crown), and a space maintainer (crown, band, and loop) to maintain the space after extraction. A glass-ionomer build-up restoration for the left maxillary incisors and canine was also deliberated. A programmed follow-up visit was planned for maxillary left permanent molar to be built-up by glass ionomer restorations as soon as completion of its eruption.\n\nThe laboratory examinations showed that the serum sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase levels were in the normal range.\n\nFinal Diagnosis: Regional Odontodysplasia\n\nSummary: The patient, a 3.5-year-old female, was admitted to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Dental School, Islamic Azad University; Tehran, Iran with chief complaints of abscess formation in the left maxillary region and abnormal crown and enamel on all primary teeth in that region. A diagnosis of Regional Odontodysplasia was proposed based on the clinical and radiological findings. The patient underwent necessary extractions and restorations and a follow-up visit was scheduled. The laboratory examinations showed normal serum levels.",

Upon examination, minimal cyanosis was observed, along with clubbing on the extremities and a systolic murmur along the left sternal border. The electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF with incomplete right bundle branch block, a right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Transthoracic echocardiography showed typical signs of TOF. A significant increase was noted in the patient's cardiac troponin T levels, with levels reaching 2,999 ng/mL.\n\nHospital Course:\nThe patient was diagnosed with STEMI and received standard medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, rosuvastatin, nitroglycerin, and enoxaparin. Emergency coronary angiography showed total occlusion of a large right coronary artery (RCA) from the second segment. Thrombus aspiration with catheter was performed multiple times and significant thrombus was sucked from RCA. However, after thrombus aspiration, there was still significant thrombus in the second and third segment of RCA, with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 on coronary angiogram. Due to the absence of obvious lesions and the fact that the diameter of RCA was 7.0 mm by quantitative coronary analysis, stenting or ballooning was deemed unreasonable. Therefore, intracoronary thrombolytic therapy with 25 mg of alteplase directly through the guiding catheter for 5 min was performed. Follow-up coronary angiography revealed complete dissolution of thrombus with TIMI 3 flow.\n\nPost-Procedure Progress and Findings:\nAfter the procedure, the complete blood count showed erythrocytosis with erythrocytes of 5.93 \u00d7 1012 /L, hemoglobin of 202 g/L, and hematocrit of 0.58, along with normal white blood cells and platelets. Blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg without inotrope or vasopressor. The patient received saline infusion with a total volume of 2,000 mL for 3 days. The follow-up hematocrit was reduced to 0.45 and blood pressure increased to 120/80 mm Hg. Holter ECG after the procedure revealed sinus tachycardia without atrial fibrillation, flutter or atrioventricular block. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) showed typical TOF with 10 mm ventricular septal defect (VSD) and severe supravalvular pulmonary stenosis.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition 10 days after the procedure with standard medications for STEMI.\n\nFollow-up:\nFollow-up appointments have been scheduled for the patient to monitor their condition and adjust their medication as needed.\n\nInstructions:\nThe patient is advised to follow their treatment plan and attend all scheduled follow-up appointments.
